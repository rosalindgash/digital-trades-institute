## **Level 1: Practical AI Literacy Certificate Overview**

### **What is this certificate?**

This certificate provides practical, non-technical foundations that apply across industries and job roles.

---

### **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this certificate, you will be able to:

1. **Distinguish AI from hype:** Understand what AI actually is, what it cannot do, and how to evaluate marketing claims critically
2. **Use AI tools as research partners:** Leverage AI for research and information gathering while maintaining verification and human judgment
3. **Read and interpret data critically:** Evaluate charts, datasets, and claims without cynicism or blind trust
4. **Communicate authentically with AI:** Use AI to draft and improve writing while maintaining your voice, accuracy, and accountability

---

### **Key Concepts**

- **Pattern-matching at scale:** AI learns patterns from examples and applies them to new situations—it's powerful but lacks common sense and human judgment
- **Training data shapes outcomes:** The quality and composition of data used to train AI systems directly determines their quality, bias, and limitations
- **Verification is non-negotiable:** AI summaries sound authoritative but require independent verification; no AI tool replaces human judgment in critical decisions
- **Smart skepticism:** Develop healthy questioning of data and claims without rejecting information; understand confidence levels and when to act on imperfect information
- **You own your communication:** Regardless of drafting source, you're responsible for accuracy, tone, authenticity, and accountability in everything you send

---
