## **Module 1: Applied AI Workflows**

## **1.1 End-to-End Task Workflows**

A workflow is a sequence of steps to accomplish a goal. AI doesn't replace workflows; it optimizes specific steps within them. Understanding where AI fits saves time and prevents wasted effort on the wrong problems.

Start by mapping your current workflow: What are you trying to accomplish? What steps does it take? Where do people get stuck or waste time? Where do you need accurate information or analysis?

AI is valuable in steps that involve: gathering information, analyzing data, generating options, drafting content, organizing information. AI is not useful in steps that require: human judgment, stakeholder decisions, physical action, relationship building, accountability.

**Real example:** A hiring workflow includes: job posting, resume screening, interviews, reference checks, offer negotiation, onboarding. AI can speed resume screening (pattern matching against job requirements). But AI shouldn't make the hire/no-hire decision (that requires human judgment about culture fit, potential, and accountability). A smart workflow uses AI for screening, then humans for interviews and decisions.

**Key principle:** Don't ask "Can we use AI here?" Ask "Where does AI reduce friction without replacing human judgment?" Build AI into steps where it genuinely helps, not everywhere.

Map your workflow first. Only then look for AI applications. This prevents the common mistake of trying to automate broken processes instead of fixing them first.

## **1.2 Chaining Tools: AI + Docs + Automation**

Single tools rarely solve complete problems. Powerful workflows chain multiple tools together: AI generates content, documentation stores it, automation schedules it, monitoring tracks results.

**Example workflow:**

Step 1: AI drafts email templates for different customer segments based on your guidelines
Step 2: You edit and approve templates in a shared document
Step 3: Automation sends appropriate template to each customer based on their profile
Step 4: Analytics track open rates and engagement
Step 5: You analyze results and refine templates for next cycle

Each tool does what it's best at. AI excels at generation. Documents excel at storage and collaboration. Automation excels at repetition. Analytics excel at tracking.

**Common chains:**

Research: AI gathers info → Document organizes findings → You synthesize → Automation distributes summary

Content: AI generates draft → Document enables collaboration → Automation publishes → Analytics track performance

Operations: AI analyzes data → Spreadsheet visualizes trends → Automation alerts on anomalies → You decide actions

The power isn't in individual tools; it's in how they pass information to each other. Bad chains have data getting stuck or lost between steps. Good chains have clear handoffs.

Identify your workflow. Map where data flows. Find tools that connect. Test the chain with small tasks before scaling.

## **1.3 Real-World Use Cases: Admin, Operations, Research**

Different roles use AI workflows differently. Understanding proven patterns helps you adapt them to your context.

**Administrative workflows:**

Schedule meetings by having AI analyze calendars and suggest times. Process expense reports by having AI extract amounts and categories, then humans approve. Manage inbox by having AI categorize emails and flag urgent ones. Generate meeting notes by having AI summarize while you focus on discussion.

**Operations workflows:**

Predict equipment maintenance by having AI analyze performance data and flag degradation. Optimize routes by having AI calculate best driver assignments. Quality control by having AI flag anomalies in production data. Inventory management by having AI forecast demand based on historical patterns.

**Research workflows:**

Literature review by having AI summarize papers and identify key themes. Data analysis by having AI process large datasets and suggest patterns. Report writing by having AI draft sections based on your findings and outline. Collaboration by having AI synthesize team input into draft recommendations.

**Common principles across all:**

1. AI handles the repetitive, pattern-matching work
2. Humans handle decisions, judgment, and exceptions
3. Workflows include verification steps (humans check AI output before it matters)
4. Results are measured to understand if the workflow actually improved things
5. Workflows evolve as you learn what works

Start with one small workflow in your role. Document it. Add AI to the highest-friction step. Measure results. Iterate.

## **1.4 Measuring Workflow Improvements**

Adding AI to a workflow changes metrics. Knowing what to measure prevents false wins.

Before implementing AI, measure baseline performance: How long does the task take? What's the current error rate? How much human effort is required? What does it cost?

After implementing AI, measure again: Did time decrease? Did quality improve? Did error rate drop? Did effort reduce? What's the new cost? Are there hidden costs (learning, maintenance, monitoring)?

**Watch for common traps:**

Speed improved but errors increased (quality trade-off). Time saved by AI but humans spend time fixing AI mistakes (no net gain). Costs decreased but employee morale dropped (people don't trust the AI). Throughput increased but accuracy decreased for critical decisions (measuring the wrong thing).

**Real example:** A company automated customer email responses with AI. Speed improved 10x. But human follow-up for confused customers tripled. Net result: worse, not better. They adjusted the workflow: AI handles simple requests, humans handle everything else. Now it's genuinely faster.

Measure what matters for your goal, not what's easiest to measure. A 50% time reduction that doubles errors isn't progress. A 10% time reduction that maintains quality while freeing humans for higher-value work is genuine improvement.

Set baseline metrics before implementing. Measure 2-4 weeks after implementation. Be honest about results. Adjust workflows based on real data.

## **1.5 When to Reject AI for a Workflow**

Not every workflow should include AI. Knowing when to say "no" is as important as knowing when to implement.

Reject AI if:

**The problem isn't understood yet.** If your process is broken or unclear, AI won't fix it—it'll optimize the brokenness. Fix the process first.

**Humans need to make the decision.** If the decision has significant consequences or requires judgment, keep humans in control. AI can support, not decide.

**Quality matters more than speed.** If accuracy is critical (medical diagnosis, legal decisions, financial compliance), AI assistance is fine. AI making the final call alone is risky.

**The cost exceeds the benefit.** If implementing AI costs more than the problem costs, don't implement it. A $5,000 tool saving $100/year isn't progress.

**You can't verify the output.** If you don't understand the domain well enough to know if AI output is correct, you can't safely use it.

**Workflow is already efficient.** If something takes 10 minutes monthly, automating it saves almost nothing.

**Real example:** A nonprofit tried to automate grant writing with AI. They realized: grant decisions are judgment calls requiring knowledge of funder priorities, their mission is specific and needs authentic voice, quality matters more than speed. They rejected AI for writing. They use AI for research (gathering funder info and past grants) and organization (structuring research). The actual writing remains human.

Smart adoption means being selective, not using AI everywhere it technically fits. Evaluate each workflow honestly.
