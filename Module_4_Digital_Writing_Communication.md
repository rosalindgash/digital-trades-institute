## **Module 4: Digital Writing & Communication**

## **4.1 Writing with AI (Without Sounding Like AI)**

AI is good at structure and clean prose. It's weak at voice, specificity, and judgment. Your revision makes the difference.

**Why AI writing sounds like AI:** Repeated phrases ("In today's digital landscape..."), formula structure (intro, three points, conclusion), formal tone everywhere, explanation for every claim, balanced voice lacking emphasis.

**What makes writing authentically yours:** Specific examples from real experience, conversational phrasing and contractions, varied sentence length, your perspective and judgment, simple words and short sentences for hard ideas.

**The revision workflow:** AI drafts, you revise for voice. Instead of keeping "I'm excited to share," change to how you'd actually say it. Replace generic examples with real ones. Add contractions. Remove corporate jargon. Shorten long sentences. Add personality.

**Where AI helps:** Structure, complete information, clean grammar, transitions, identifying what you forgot to explain.

**Where you must lead:** Voice, specific examples, judgment about what matters, accuracy, authenticity.

Real example: AI produces "Leverage synergies across functional stakeholders." You revise: "Work together across teams." Both communicate the idea. One sounds generated; one sounds like you.

Before sending anything, ask: Could someone who knows me tell I wrote this? Are there phrases I'd never say? Do I stand behind every claim? Does the tone match how I communicate? If the answer to any is no, revise until it's authentically yours.

## **4.2 Professional Communication Workflows**

Purpose-driven communication beats generic templates.

**Before drafting, ask:** Who am I talking to? What do they currently understand? What do I want them to know or do? What's their concern about this topic?

**Audience analysis:**
- Business executive cares about ROI and risk
- Team member cares about how it affects them
- Customer cares about value and reliability

Same information, different angles.

**Prompt construction:** Instead of "Write an email," try "Write an email asking [person] to [action]. Context: [situation]. Address their likely concern: [concern]. Keep it under 200 words. Tone: [professional/warm/direct]."

**Three communication types need different structures:**

**Persuasive:** You're asking someone to do something. Start with what you need. Address their concern. Show evidence. Make clear what comes next.

**Informative:** You're explaining something. Lead with the main point. Provide support. End with what to do with this information.

**Collaborative:** You're building agreement. Frame the problem. Invite input. Summarize agreements. Confirm next steps.

Real workflow: Plan (who, what, why) → Draft with AI using a specific prompt → Revise for your voice → Add specific examples → Verify accuracy → Get peer feedback → Send.

## **4.3 Editing, Tone Control, and Audience Alignment**

Editing happens at three levels.

**Macro editing:** Does this accomplish its goal? Is it organized logically? Is everything relevant? Is it the right length? If the main idea isn't clear in the first paragraph, move it there. If you have tangential points, delete them or move to appendix. If it's too long, cut sections, not words.

**Micro editing:** Are sentences clear? Long sentences confuse. Break them into two. Replace passive voice ("It was decided") with active ("I decided"). Replace vague words ("utilize") with simple ones ("use"). Delete redundancy.

**Line editing:** Do individual words match your tone? Is language natural? Do sentences flow? Read aloud—you'll catch awkward phrasing.

**Tone is controlled by formality, language, structure, and pronouns:**

Formal: "I am writing to inform you..." | Standard: "I wanted to let you know..." | Casual: "Quick heads-up..."

Match tone to audience and context. Executive presentations are formal. Internal team emails are standard. Casual messages to peers are conversational.

Real example: Original (formal): "In order to facilitate better communication between departments, a series of meetings were scheduled by management..." Revised (clear): "Management scheduled meetings to help departments understand each other's priorities."

Before sending: Is formality consistent? Do I sound like myself? Is tone warm/cold as intended? Are facts correct?

## **4.4 AI as Drafting Partner, Not Author**

You're responsible for everything you communicate, regardless of who drafted it.

**When to disclose AI use:** Academic and professional credibility contexts. When someone is paying for your original work. When your audience would want to know. When organizational policy requires it.

**When not necessarily:** Routine drafting assistance (like spell-checking). Output heavily revised until it's authentically yours. Context doesn't require it.

**What AI can't do:** Verify facts (you must check). Take positions responsibly (you must own claims). Understand your specific situation (you must judge context). Provide accountability (you're responsible).

**The integrity test:** Would I be uncomfortable if the recipient discovered AI drafted this? Do I stand behind every claim? Have I verified facts? Does this represent my actual thinking, or someone else's?

If the answer is "no" to any, don't send. Revise first.

**Building AI into your workflow:** Think → Draft with AI → Revise substantially → Verify facts → Own it. This produces well-organized (AI) but authentically yours (you) communication.

Wrong approach: Get AI to write the entire thing, tweak slightly, send. You're not fully engaged; inaccuracies might slip through; it doesn't reflect your thinking.

Right approach: Use AI to get started and organize, then rewrite substantially. When you do, it's genuinely yours.

## **4.5 Communication Across Platforms**

The same message in email feels different in chat, different in a video call, different in formal documentation. Match platform to importance and permanence.

**Email:** Permanent record, formal, archived. Best for important decisions and detailed explanations. Professional tone but can be friendly. 200-500 words typical.

**Chat (Slack, Teams):** Informal, fast, lost in stream. Best for quick questions and coordination. Casual, friendly tone. One-two sentences.

**Video calls:** Real-time, allows nuance through tone and body language. Best for complex discussions and conflict. Conversational tone. 15 minutes to 1 hour.

**Documentation:** Permanent, searchable, shared. Best for processes and decisions. Clear and formal. Structure with headings.

**Social media:** Public, permanent, broadcast. Best for announcements and brand voice. Professional but authentic. Short, visuals matter.

**Platform mistakes:** Email when chat is fine loses permanence of important info. Chat for important decisions loses formal record. Video call when email works wastes people's time. Documentation that's outdated confuses more than it helps.

**Choosing platform:** Does this need a permanent record? (Email, documentation) Is this time-sensitive and informal? (Chat) Does this need back-and-forth? (Video call) Is this institutional knowledge people need to find later? (Documentation) Does tone and nuance matter greatly? (Video call)

**One message, different platforms:** Same policy announcement becomes formal email with full detail, Slack summary with key points, video discussion acknowledging concerns. Same core message, platform-appropriate delivery.
